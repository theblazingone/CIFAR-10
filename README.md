# CIFAR-10
### The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32Ã—32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

Using CIFAR-10 dataset from keras to differentiate betweeen CNN and ANN. Recognising images from CIFAR-10 dataset is the most common problem and I have tried to use neural networks to get a comparison between convolution and artificial networks.
